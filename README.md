# Getting Started

## Overview
This repository, `tutorial-blockchain-elements`, is a core component of an overall reference architecture that I promote for building secure enterprise and Internet-scale web applications.  The is API repository can be used as a template to build microservices in an efficient and repeatable way. There is no need to reinvent the wheel and many best practices are already baked into this solution.

This example API is built on the .NET Core and is cross platform compatiable.  It can run locally on any platform that can host .NET Core and is specifically implemented to run within Linux-based Docker containers.

### Quick Install
The following steps will quickly get you up and running and testing this API.

1. Install the dependencies (details below)
1. Fork the repository
1. Clone the forked repository
1. Run the build and test commands
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    dotnet build
    ```
1. Manually run the unit and integration tests
    ```bash
    dotnet test
    ```
1. Run the application
    ```bash
    dotnet run -p src/Infrastructure.WebApi/
    ```
1. Manually test the application
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:5000/api/ping
    ```

Or you can just copy and paste the above URL your browsers address bar.

### Errors
If you experience errors, it is likely that you do not have all of the requisite dependencies installed.  Please ensure that you do. Follow the instructions, below.

If it turns out that you do have all of the dependencies installed and you are still experiencing errors, please create a new Issue.

## Install Dependencies
There are a number of depenedencies that must be installed locally on your development machine in order to get this application to build and run.  The dependencies are detailed below, along with direct links that you can use to download them.

The following table lists the absolute minimum requirements for building and running the reference API.

| Dependency | Description
| :--- | :---
| .Net CLI| Command-Line Interface tool needed to compile and run the source code
| MongoDB | Running database required to execute the application or tests in the local environment.
| Docker | Must be installed and running in order to run the application entirely in Docker containers



### Git SCM
Install [Git SCM][3] for your given platform.  This will install the git bash command-line tool that has all of the environment variables arleady configured.  There is also an option to install the environment variables for use with the standard Windows command-line or OSX Terminal.

Though they are not required, it may also be useful to install [GitHub for Windows or GitHub for Mac][2].

### .Net Command-Line Interface
You will want to install the [dotnet-cli][1] and associated tools.  The build script used in this repository have a dependency on the .NET command-line tools.

### Docker
You will need to install Docker on your local development machine.
1. Install [Docker for Windows][9]
2. Install [Docker for Mac][8]

## Fork the Repository
Navigate in your browswer to the tutorial-blockchain-elements repository.
https://github.com/walterpinson/tutorial-blockchain-elements

Follow the GitHub instructions for [Forking a Repository][10].

## Clone the Fork
Navigate to your fork of the tutorial-blockchain-elements repository.  Follow the GitHub instructions for [Cloning a Repository][11].

## Build / Test
You can manually build the API on your local host by running the following commands in a git-bash window, terminal window, or Windows command-line window after switching to the repository root directory.

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

If you want to run the unit tests and the integration tests, issue the following commnand.

```bash
dotnet test
```

If you want to launch the API on your local host, issue the following command.

```bash
dotnet run
```

The [dotnet command-line interface documentation][12] is quite useful for those looking for command-line mastery.


## Run
There are a number of scripts that can be used to expedite each aspect of the manual build process or tie them all together in order to get the application running in a Docker container.


### Build and run the application as a docker container
```bash
sh/run.sh
```

This command deletes any existing containers, and rebuilds the source, rebuilds the docker image, and reruns the container.  This is your go-to command. When you make some code changes and you want your running docker container to reflect those code changes, this is is the command that you run.

#### Build the source and publish the application
`sh/build_app.sh`

#### Build the Docker image from the published application
`sh/build_image.sh`

#### Run the Docker image as a container
`sh/build_container.sh`
